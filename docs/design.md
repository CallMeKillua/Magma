# Magma Programming Language - Design Document
# Overview

Magma is a statically-typed, high-performance programming language with a strong orientation towards web development.
The language aims to provide a powerful and expressive platform for professional developers to build efficient and
sophisticated web applications. Magma combines the best elements of TypeScript and Rust, integrating both functional and
object-oriented programming paradigms while emphasizing safety, performance, and flexibility.

## Key Features

### Statically Typed
Magma offers a robust type system with support for a variety of primitive types, including unsigned and signed integers,
Booleans, and a Unit type. Type inference is supported, allowing developers to omit type annotations in variable
declarations and function return types when they can be inferred by the compiler.

### Memory Safety
Inspired by Rust's borrow checker, Magma provides mechanisms to ensure safe memory management and prevent data races.

### Expressive Control Flow
Magma supports if-else statements, while loops, do-while loops, and match statements for pattern matching, providing
developers with expressive and flexible control flow constructs.

### Functions and Closures
Functions in Magma can be defined with concise syntax and support higher-order functions. Return type annotations are
optional when the return type is inferrable. Magma also supports anonymous objects, closures, and function types with
varying levels of mutability.

### Classes and Traits
Magma supports classes with associated methods and traits that provide shared behavior for types. Traits enable
abstraction, code reuse, and polymorphism.

### Error Handling
Magma uses a 'Result' type for error handling, with 'Ok' and 'Err' variants. Pattern matching is used to handle
different outcomes and errors gracefully.

### Compilation to WebAssembly
Magma compiles to WebAssembly for high-performance execution on the web, enabling cross-platform compatibility.

### Extensibility
Magma allows for language extensions, such as JSX-like markup syntax, to facilitate building user interfaces.

## Syntax Highlights

### Variable and Constant Declaration
```
let a_number: I16 = 420;
const another_value = 100I32;
```

### Match Statement
```
match myError {
Ok(value) => {
// Handle success
}
Err(e) => {
// Handle error
}
}
```

### Function Declaration
```
def add_values_without_block(first: U32, second: U32) => first + second;
```

### Class and Trait Definition
```
class def Vector(x: I32, y: I32) => Self { ... }
trait Result[T] { ... }
impl Result[T] for Ok[T] { ... }
```

### Anonymous Objects
```
def create_anonymous() => Self {
    const field = "value";
    def method() => "method output";
};
```

## Goals and Objectives

Magma aims to provide developers with a powerful and user-friendly language for web development. The language's design
principles emphasize safety, performance, and flexibility, with support for both functional and object-oriented
paradigms. The ultimate goal is to enable the development of high-performance web applications that are secure,
maintainable, and scalable.

## Conclusion

Magma is a promising programming language that addresses the need for a high-performance language tailored for web
development. Through its expressive syntax, robust type system, and versatile features, Magma empowers developers to
create sophisticated web applications with ease and confidence.

## Next Steps

The next steps in the development of Magma include formalizing the semantics of the language, implementing the compiler
and runtime system, and building a standard library. Additionally, continuous iteration, feedback, and refinement of the
language
